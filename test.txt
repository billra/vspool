Test vspool library

Import:

	>>> from vspool import *

These numbers were verified by Rhino drawing of configuration.
See tests.PNG

Base Test:

	>>> Cx,Cy = 0,4 # center of spool
	>>> Px,Py = 7,-1 # point being plotted
	>>> r = 3 # radius of spool
	>>> cs = vspoolinverse(Cx,Cy,Px,Py,r)
	>>> print(cs)
	10.9916946...

The same, but abbreviated:

	>>> print(vspoolinverse(0,4,7,-1,3))
	10.9916946...

Below and to the left:

	>>> print(vspoolinverse(0,4,-3,0,3))
	12.573395633...

Above and to the left:
This is an interesting case in that it shows that the top of the spool is an arbitrary measurement starting point.
The length of the line not touching the spool is added, and the length of the line which would touch if wrapped around is subtracted.

	>>> print(vspoolinverse(0,4,-1,9,3))
	0.705574...

end of tests.
